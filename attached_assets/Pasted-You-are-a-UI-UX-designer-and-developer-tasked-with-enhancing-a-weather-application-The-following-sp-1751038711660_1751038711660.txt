You are a UI/UX designer and developer tasked with enhancing a weather application. The following specifications need to be implemented:

### User Story:
1. **Multiple Cities**
   - Create an interface that allows users to add multiple cities for weather tracking. Ensure that users can view the added cities easily.

2. **Dark Mode**
   - Integrate a dark mode option in the settings of the app. This should allow users to toggle between light and dark themes seamlessly.

3. **Pull Down to Refresh**
   - Implement a "pull down to refresh" feature that enables users to manually refresh the weather data displayed on the app.

### Visual Presentation:
1. **Temperature Display**
   - Display the temperature at **28 degrees** in bold text, using a **white color**.
   - Adjust the entire temperature section to be slightly lower on the screen and center it vertically.

2. **Humidity Section**
   - Remove the dew point line from the humidity section.
   - Modify the humidity bar to reflect values through percentages instead of other visual representations.

3. **10-Day Forecast**
   - Include weather icons next to each day in the 10-day forecast to represent the expected weather conditions accurately.

4. **Rain Indicator**
   - Shorten the visual indicator for moderate or heavy rain events, ensuring it includes an icon depicting thunder when applicable.

5. **Date Format**
   - Make sure the app does not show the date in the Islamic calendar format. Stick to standard Gregorian date formatting.

6. **Temperature Headline**
   - Remove the headline for the 24-hour temperature display to streamline the UI.

### Design Aesthetics:
1. **Background Design**
   - Change the background of the UI to have a glass-like box aesthetic, giving it a modern and sleek appearance.

2. **Rain Visual Effects**
   - If rain is detected, incorporate dynamic visual effects to illustrate rain on the screen, adjusting according to weather conditions in real-time.
